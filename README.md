Disclaimer: This solution is developed for [ClimateHack](https://climatehack.io/) to address climate change.

## Overview
  
Land owners with more than 10 hectares of trees can tokenize their trees and mint 1 $TREE token for every 1 kilogram of CO2 their land offsets (vested over a period of 10 years).

$TREE tokens are listed on 3verse where interested organizations/individuals can purchase and stake for $O2 tokens (Daily yield per $TREE token is 0.29 $O2 tokens).

Individuals/organizations who wish to offset their carbon footprint can redeem $O2 tokens (1 $O2 token = 1kg of CO2) in exchange for an on-chain carbon credit certificate.

## Features

**Buy** - Purchase $TREE token(s) you wish to own.

**Stake** - Stake your $TREE token(s) to receive $O2 tokens

**Offset** - Offset your carbon footprint to go carbon neutral to benefit the environment

**Exchange** - Trade your $TREE or $O2 token(s) on the marketplace
